Oracle setup instruction
1. Download database for windows
https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/db-express/OracleXE213_Win64.zip
2.Extract files to your folder
3. Check you current IP and save it or change it to a static one. (It's important cause after the installation if you change your ip adress the connection wouldn't be able to be established)
4. Open the folder where you extracted the files and start the setup.exe file.
5. Install the database.
6. After installation you should be able to connect to your database via sqldeveloper for example.
7. Open sql developer as username set "sys" and set your role to SYSDBA and enter your password that you typed while installing database.
8. Create new user:
	CREATE USER C##Admin IDENTIFIED BY qwer;
	GRANT CREATE SESSION TO C##Admin;
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO C##Admin;
USEFUL INFO:
After altering something in sqldeveloper finish everything with COMMIT so the java app would get the changed info in database.

Tables that need to be created:
CREATE TABLE usersInfo (
    user_id      NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, 
    username     VARCHAR2(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
    password     VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL, 
    email        VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
    created_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

INSERT INTO usersInfo (username,password,email) VALUES ('Test','Test','Test');
