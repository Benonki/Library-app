# Library App

A library management system developed in Java with Oracle Database integration, enabling efficient handling of books, users, loans, and returns with secure and reliable data storage.

## Setup (Part 1 - if you have already installed oracle skip to Part 2)
1. Download database for windows: 
    ```bash
    https://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/otn_software/db-express/OracleXE213_Win64.zip
    ```
2. Extract files to your folder
3. Check you current IP and save it or change it to a static one. (It's important cause after the installation if you change your ip adress the connection wouldn't be able to be established).
4. Open the folder where you extracted the files and start the setup.exe file.
5. Install the database.
6. After installation you should be able to connect to your database via sqldeveloper for example.
7. Open sql developer as username set "sys" and set your role to SYSDBA and enter your password that you typed while installing database.

## Setup (Part 2)

1. Create new user:
   ```sql
   CREATE USER C##Admin IDENTIFIED BY qwer;
	GRANT CREATE SESSION TO C##Admin;
	GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO C##Admin;
   ```
   
2. in sqldeveloper create a new database connection, in name type "DB" and in username and password those: "C##Admin" and "qwer".
3. Tables that need to be created in a new created database:
```sql
  CREATE TABLE usersInfo (
    user_id      NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY, 
    username     VARCHAR2(50) UNIQUE NOT NULL, 
    password     VARCHAR2(255) NOT NULL, 
    email        VARCHAR2(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    role         VARCHAR2(20) DEFAULT 'Reader' NOT NULL,
    created_at   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```
4. Insert this into table:
```sql
INSERT INTO usersInfo (username, password, email, role) VALUES
   ('Reader1', 'Reader1', 'Reader1@example.com', 'Reader');
INSERT INTO usersInfo (username, password, email, role) VALUES
   ('Employee1', 'Employee1', 'Employee1@example.com', 'Employee');
INSERT INTO usersInfo (username, password, email, role) VALUES
   ('Manager1', 'Manager1', 'Manager1@example.com', 'Manager');
INSERT INTO usersInfo (username, password, email, role) VALUES
   ('Coordinator1', 'Coordinator1', 'Coordinator1@example.com', 'Coordinator');
```
5. After altering something in sqldeveloper finish everything with COMMIT so the java app would get the changed info in database.
